    "Grid search CV (Cross-Validation) is a hyperparameter tuning technique used in machine learning to optimize the performance of a model by finding the best combination of hyperparameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hyperparameters are settings of a model that are not learned from the data, such as learning rate, regularization parameters, number of hidden layers in a neural network, etc. These hyperparameters can have a significant impact on the performance of a model, and it can be difficult to determine the optimal values by trial and error.\n",
    "\n",
    "Grid search CV works by systematically searching over a grid of possible hyperparameter combinations and evaluating the model performance for each combination using cross-validation. Cross-validation is a technique for assessing the performance of a model by training and testing it on multiple subsets of the data."

    "Grid search CV involves searching over a predefined set of hyperparameters in a grid-like manner. A range of values for each hyperparameter is specified in advance, and the algorithm tests all possible combinations of these hyperparameters to find the optimal set of values. Grid search is typically used when the number of hyperparameters is small and their values are discrete.\n",
    "\n",
    "Random search CV, on the other hand, searches over a randomized set of hyperparameters. The algorithm randomly samples hyperparameters from a distribution of values specified for each hyperparameter, and tests these random combinations to find the optimal set of values. Random search is typically used when the number of hyperparameters is large, or when their values are continuous.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main advantage of random search over grid search is that it can be more efficient in finding optimal hyperparameters, especially when the number of hyperparameters is large. Random search is also more likely to find good solutions when the optimal hyperparameters are located in a small region of the hyperparameter space."

    "Use cross-validation: Cross-validation is a technique that helps prevent data leakage by splitting the data into training and validation sets. This ensures that the model is evaluated on data that it has not seen during training.\n",

    "Use time-series data correctly: If the data is time-series data, it is important to ensure that the model is not trained on data from the future. For example, in financial time-series data, it is important to ensure that the model is not trained on data that has not yet been released."
